GAMEPLAY
*************************************

The button in the top-right corner toggles an AI player on and off.

N.B. This button is not available partway through a game.

IN AI MODE:
- You are X and you go first. Make your move by clicking on any square.
- You'll see the AI's O move appear on screen.
- If you draw/stalemate or win against the AI, you can level up to a larger grid.
- You can also replay the same grid size again (because TIC TAC TOE!!!!!!!).
- The AI is a very defensive player... try to force him into letting you take the win.

IN TWO PLAYER MODE:
- Each person takes a turn to click on the grid to make their move. X goes first.
- You can level up to a larger grid at the end of any match.

There are a total of 10 levels to startle and amaze.
Enjoy your journey.
